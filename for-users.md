# For integrators and end users

The MPAI family of standards envisage a full end-to-end [ecosystem](https://mpai.community/standards/mpai-gme). The MPAI Store is the linchpin of this ecosystem, allowing software developers to offer components and/or applications, integrators to acquire components, and end users to download applications and even optimize them by replacing particular components with more performant ones.

The MPAI Store offers a catalog of software modules and workflows. They are all tested for conformance and their performance level is independently assessed and made available on the MPAI Store catalog, so that integrators and users can make an informed choice between different offers according to their needs. The component-based approach to AI applications supported by MPAI standards allows integrators and users to build safe and secure workflows from the bottom up out of tested and assessed components offering guaranteed performance.
