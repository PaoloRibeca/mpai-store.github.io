# For developers

Are you a developer of AI applications? [MPAI](https://mpai.community) standards allow you to develop modular AI applications and their components in an well-defined, interoperable, and robust way. Applications are defined as _AI workflows_ (AIWs) composed of interconnected _AI modules_ (AIMs); they are run inside standard execution orchestrators called _AI frameworks_.
